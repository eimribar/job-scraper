# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Execute SQL Migration

1. **Supabase SQL Editor is now open in your browser**
2. **Copy the entire contents** of: `migrations/create-search-terms-table.sql`
3. **Paste into the SQL editor** and click "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter)

This will create:
- âœ… **search_terms** table with 37 search terms
- âœ… **notifications** table for real-time alerts
- âœ… **processing_runs** table for tracking automation

## Step 2: Verify Setup

After executing the SQL, run this command:

```bash
node scripts/setup-search-terms.js
```

This will:
- Verify tables were created
- Display all 37 search terms organized by priority
- Create a sample notification

## Step 3: Check the Dashboard

## üöÄ HOW TO START COMPLETE AUTOMATION

### Method 1: Individual Services (For Debugging)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the web app
PORT=3001 npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start continuous analysis worker
node scripts/continuous-analysis.js

# Terminal 3: Start weekly scraping scheduler
node scripts/weekly-scraper.js
```

### Method 2: All-in-One (Recommended)

```bash
# Start everything at once
node scripts/start-automation.js
```

This starts:
- ‚úÖ Continuous analysis worker
- ‚úÖ Weekly scraping scheduler
- ‚úÖ Automatic restarts on failure
- ‚úÖ Consolidated logging

---

## üìä WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY

### Daily
- New jobs are analyzed within seconds of being scraped
- Companies using Outreach.io/SalesLoft are detected immediately
- Dashboard updates in real-time
- All processes monitor themselves and restart on failure

### Weekly
- All 37 search terms are scraped for new jobs
- Up to 18,500 new jobs added (37 √ó 500 max)
- Duplicate jobs are automatically filtered out
- New jobs feed directly into analysis pipeline

### Monthly
- System continues running without intervention
- Accumulated thousands of companies analyzed
- Steady detection of companies using sales tools
- Complete audit trail in database

## üîß MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### Check Status
```bash
# Check if services are running
ps aux | grep "continuous-analysis\|weekly-scraper"

# Check job queue status
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env.local' });
const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
supabase.from('job_queue').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }).then(({count}) => console.log('Total jobs:', count));
supabase.from('companies').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }).then(({count}) => console.log('Total companies:', count));
"
```

### Logs Location
- Continuous Analysis: Console output shows real-time job processing
- Weekly Scraper: Console output shows weekly scraping progress
- API Logs: Check Next.js dev server output

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Process all pending jobs immediately
node scripts/process-all-pending.js

# Test single analysis
node scripts/test-single-analysis.js

# Force weekly scrape (don't wait for schedule)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/scrape/weekly
```

## üéØ EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

### Processing Speed
- **Analysis**: ~1 job per second with GPT-5-mini
- **Scraping**: ~500 jobs in 2-3 minutes per search term
- **Weekly Batch**: ~6-8 hours to process all terms

### Detection Rates
- **Current Rate**: ~3-5% of jobs contain tool mentions
- **Expected Weekly**: 50-100 new companies detected
- **Target Tools**: ONLY Outreach.io and SalesLoft (no false positives)

### Resource Usage
- **API Costs**: ~$5-10 per week (OpenAI + Apify)
- **Processing Time**: Continuous background processing
- **Storage**: Grows by ~18k jobs per week

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- GPT-5-mini-2025-08-07 with correct parameters
- JSON response format enforcement
- Automatic error recovery
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Deduplication by job signature
- Background processing

### üö´ WHAT TO AVOID
- **NEVER** use models other than gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07
- **DON'T** interrupt weekly scraping (it recovers automatically)
- **DON'T** manually delete jobs from job_queue table
- **AVOID** running multiple instances of same script

### üîÑ AUTO-RECOVERY
- Services restart automatically on crash
- Failed API calls are retried with delays  
- Malformed responses get default values
- Database connection issues auto-reconnect

---

## üéâ SUCCESS METRICS

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ New jobs appear in job_queue table weekly
- ‚úÖ Jobs get `analyzed: true` within minutes
- ‚úÖ Companies with tools appear in dashboard
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed for weeks/months

---

## üìû TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No jobs being processed"
```bash
# Check if continuous worker is running
ps aux | grep continuous-analysis

# Restart if needed
node scripts/continuous-analysis.js
```

### "Weekly scraping not working" 
```bash
# Check scheduler
ps aux | grep weekly-scraper

# Force manual scrape
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/scrape/trigger -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"searchTerm":"SDR","maxJobs":10}'
```

### "Dashboard not updating"
- Check if Next.js dev server is running on port 3001
- Refresh browser cache
- Check Supabase connection

## üöÄ NEXT LEVEL AUTOMATION

Once this is stable, consider:
- Deploy to cloud server (AWS/Digital Ocean) for 24/7 uptime
- Set up monitoring alerts (email/Slack when detections found)
- Scale to more search terms and job platforms
- Add competitor analysis features

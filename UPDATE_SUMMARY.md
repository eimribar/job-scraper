# 📋 Project Update Summary - Sales Tool Detector

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.1

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- ✅ Created migration script (`migrations/add-unique-constraint.sql`) to add unique constraint on `(company, tool_detected)`
- ✅ Added performance indexes for faster queries
- ✅ Created helper script (`scripts/run-db-migration.js`) for easier migration management

### 2. Processing Pipeline Improvements
- ✅ Developed **Optimized Processor** (`scripts/optimized-processor.js`) with:
  - Retry logic for failed API calls (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
  - Rate limiting to prevent API overload
  - Real-time progress tracking with ETA calculations
  - Memory-efficient company caching
  - Cost estimation for API usage
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### 3. System Monitoring
- ✅ Created **System Monitor** (`scripts/monitor-system.js`) featuring:
  - Real-time health checks for Database and OpenAI API
  - Live statistics dashboard
  - Processing queue status
  - 24-hour activity tracking
  - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
  - Color-coded terminal output

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Added **Quick Start Guide** (`QUICK_START.md`) for rapid onboarding
- ✅ Created `.env.local.example` template for easy setup
- ✅ Updated migration documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Apply Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Check for duplicates
   node scripts/check-duplicates.js
   
   # Apply migration via Supabase Dashboard
   # Copy content from migrations/add-unique-constraint.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Start Using Optimized Processor**
   ```bash
   # For production processing
   node scripts/optimized-processor.js
   
   # For monitoring
   node scripts/monitor-system.js
   ```

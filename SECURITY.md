## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep updated** - Always use the latest version
- **Secure credentials** - Use strong, unique passwords
- **Environment variables** - Never commit API keys or secrets
- **Network security** - Use HTTPS in production
- **Regular audits** - Review access and permissions regularly

### For Developers

- **Input validation** - Validate all user inputs
- **Output encoding** - Properly encode outputs
- **Authentication** - Implement proper auth mechanisms
- **Authorization** - Follow principle of least privilege
- **Dependency updates** - Keep dependencies current
- **Security testing** - Include security tests in CI/CD

## 🔧 Security Features

### Current Implementation

- **Environment-based secrets** - No hardcoded credentials
- **Input validation** - API request validation
- **Rate limiting** - Protection against abuse
- **Error handling** - No sensitive data in error messages
- **HTTPS enforcement** - Secure communication only
- **Dependency scanning** - Regular vulnerability checks

### Planned Enhancements

- **Authentication system** - User login and session management
- **Role-based access** - Granular permission controls
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive activity tracking
- **2FA support** - Two-factor authentication
- **API key management** - Secure key rotation
- **Data encryption** - Encryption at rest and in transit

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Dependencies

- **Apify scrapers** - External service dependency
- **OpenAI API** - Data sent to external AI service
- **Supabase** - Third-party database service

### Data Handling

- **Job descriptions** - May contain sensitive company information
- **API keys** - Stored in environment variables
- **Database access** - Protected by Supabase security

### Recommendations
